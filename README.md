# ColoredMap
A Slay the Spire mod for making the map look nicer and making it easier to read.

Because all map icons are black with some looking similar to others, it can require a lot of effort to read the map. With this mod you can configure the color of icons allowing you to make the icons you care about easy to notice while making the map look better too.

# Configuration
By default the colors of the map are unaffected. You can configure them in this mod's configuration panel.
